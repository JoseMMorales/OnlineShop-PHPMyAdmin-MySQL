Hands on exercise to building MySQL database up using one of the most popular tools for web hosting services, able to handle SQL queries by writing PHP code. It is free to use just setting up a local server to start with. 

In my case I have been working with [XAMPP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=h6DEDm7C37A&feature=emb_logo) which is a cross-platform web server solution developed by Apache Friends.
